# 🌦️ Global Weather Trend Forecasting

This project analyzes and forecasts global weather trends using the **Global Weather Repository** dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to apply both basic and advanced data science techniques to predict future temperature patterns and extract meaningful insights from the data.

## ✅ Key Features

- 📅 Time series forecasting using `temperature_celsius` as the target variable
- 🧹 Data cleaning, preprocessing, and normalization
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- 🔮 Forecasting models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, and more
- 🌍 Climate trend analysis (yearly & monthly)
- 🧠 Feature importance and multivariate modeling

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Global Weather Repository (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository)
- Time-based data with over 40 weather-related features from cities around the world

## 📌 Project Structure

- `GlobalWeatherRepository.ipynb`: Main notebook with all code and analysis
- `GlobalWeatherRepository.csv`: Cleaned and preprocessed data
- Visualizations and performance metrics included

## 📈 Forecast Target

- **Target Variable**: `temperature_celsius`
- **Time Index**: `last_updated`
